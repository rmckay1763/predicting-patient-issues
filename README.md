# Predicting Patient Issues
For dependency installation, use the pipreqs module to generate a requirements.txt

Use this command to install pipreqs:
`pip3 install pipreqs`

Once the pipreqs module is installed, move the current working directory to /api and generate the requirements.txt by:
`python3 -m pipreqs.pipreqs .`

To install modules from requirements.txt, run this command:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all necessary Python modules to run the backend service. Make sure to do this process with each fetch/pull.
